# Torque-Bounded Admittance Control with Meta-Learning Adaptive Algorithm

This repository accompanies the paper "Torque-Bounded Admittance Control with
Meta-Learning Adaptive Algorithm". And the complete code will be made available after the publication of this manuscript.


## Getting started

Ensure you are using Python 3 and Ubuntu operating system. Clone this repository and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. In particular, this code uses [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).


## Reproducing results

Training data, trained parameters, and test results are all conveniently saved in this repository, since it can take a while to re-generate them. 

Training data can be generated with the command `python generate_data.py`.

Parameters can then be trained with the command `./train_rk38.sh`. This will take a while.

Finally, test results can be produced with the commands `test_single_AdmDI.py` , `python test_DISM.py` and `./test_single_ML.sh` respectively.
